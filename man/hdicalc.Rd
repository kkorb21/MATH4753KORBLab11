\title{Compute the Highest Density Interval (HDI) and Equal Tail Interval (ETI)}
\usage{
hdicalc(stem = "norm", args = list(mean = 10, sd = 5), alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{stem}{Character string. Distribution prefix (e.g., `"norm"`, `"beta"`, `"gamma"`).}

\item{args}{List of named arguments passed to the distribution functions.
For example, `list(mean = 10, sd = 5)` for normal, or `list(shape1 = 3, shape2 = 10)` for beta.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Total significance level (e.g. 0.05).}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\item{alpha1}{Lower tail probability for HDI, where density at both endpoints matches.}
\item{alpha2}{Upper tail probability for HDI (i.e., `alpha - alpha1`).}
\item{HDI}{Numeric vector of lower and upper bounds for the HDI.}
\item{RHDI}{Width of the HDI (difference between bounds).}
\item{ETI}{Numeric vector of equal-tail bounds.}
\item{RETI}{Width of the ETI.}
}
\description{
Calculates the HDI and ETI for a given distribution using quantile and density matching.
This is especially helpful for asymmetric distributions (e.g. Beta, Gamma), where HDIs are preferred
over equal tail intervals due to their shorter length and alignment with maximum density.
